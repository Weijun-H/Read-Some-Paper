# Read-Some-Paper

This repo is a reading list related to modern data management system. I will keep updating this repo whenever I read a new paper. I will also keep updating the list of papers I read in the past. I hope this repo can help you find some interesting papers.

For each paper, I will give an abstract and mind map. I will also give a link to the paper and the slides if available. I will also give a link to the video if available. Each paper will be attached to an issue, and you can discuss the paper in the issue.
